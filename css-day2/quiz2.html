        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: <br/>
        it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth <br/>
        and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. <br/>
        Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. <br/>
        Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, <br/>
        purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as <br/>
        cat-specific body language.

          It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, <br/>
          where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC, <br/>
          but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that <br/>
          their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.
